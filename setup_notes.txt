ARC SETUP NOTES
===============

General Requirements
====================

Host prerequesites:
httpd / passenger
java > 1.6
ruby 1.9.3
an arc user with read/write access to the www directores for each compenent
httpd virtual host configurations for each of the projects
ssh keypair for development machine (used for deploy)
mysql

Catalog Setup
=============
The catalog is composed of 2 parts, solr and the RoR catalog application. The catalog
can be configured to use a local install of solr, or point to a pre-existing installation. 
These steps assume a full install with local instance of solr. 

SOLR
----
On the target host, checkout a copy of solr with: 
	git clone git@github.com:collex/solr.git
Follow the direction in the README to get the instance of SOLR ready. 
Start it up as an ongoing process. Navigate to http://[host]:8983/solr and be sure you
are presented with the solor landing page. 

Catalog
-------
Next, on your development machine, checkout a copy of the catalog with:
	git clone git@github.com:collex/catalog.git
Follow the installation instructions found in the README to get the catalog
configured and deployed to your target host.

If you need to create a new admin user for the catalog, move to the catalog
directory on the deploy host and run 'rake users:create'

Once running, access the catalog website as an admin user. Navigate to the Meta
section and be sure all of the content for the archives, genres, disciplines
and federations is up to date.

Pay particular attention to the IP addresses present in the federations data as
this is used to allow access to non-free culture resources.

Indexing
========
All of the indexing related tasks are handled by the catalog with rake tasks. Detailed
instructions on these tasks are found in the catalog README. Here is a sumary:

	rake solr_index:archive_test archive=name   : test archive for markup errors
	rake solr_index:index archive=name          : index an archive into a testing index  
	rake solr_index:merge_archive archive=name  : merge the test index into the main index

Exceptions:

The ECCO archive needs to have each typewright enabled documemnt marked as such. There is
a specialized rake task to handle this:

	 rake ecco:typewright_enable file=ecco_tw_enabled.txt
